					boxes for cash, locked vehicles or tents for storage.</p>
					<p class="v-title">1. Consideration / Compensation:</p>
					<p><strong>(a)</strong> Uprising Fest will be allotted space for that of 10 vendors and it is not first come, first
					serve. Each application will be considered by that of an 8 person panel team. Applications
					will be open March 25th through April 25th, releasing the final outcome April 30th 2019.
					We’d like to thank all applicants for their time and creativity and wish the best for any
					involvement.</p>
					<p><strong>(b)</strong> In exchange for the full service fee (see below) each vendor will receive the space
					necessary to display your products and or services for the duration of the main event,
					Saturday June 8th 10am to 10pm. This may include a table, chairs, electrical outlets, and a
					backdrop if requested.</p>
					<p><strong>(c)</strong> Along with the space provided, you will be listed among all graphics and event
					information across a multitude of online sites. Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and our
					very own webpage coming March 2019. You will be given the option to self promote
					under any and all outlets you currently use. You may also promote publicly at the event,
					this includes posters amongst the forest, fliers among cars, and word of mouth.</p>

					<p class="v-title">2. Service Fee:</p>
					<p>As a non-profit organization, we are only able to provide this experience through ticket
					sales. Any and all money collected, goes directly into the production of this event. We
					have determined that in exchange for your ability to make a profit, a fee of $15 will be
					charged to put towards creating this event and in turn your space there. This is half that
					of an attendee ticket, and you will not be charged parking. Once we make our decision
					on the 10 total vendors, we will accept payments.</p>
					<p class="v-title">3. Vendor Agreement:</p>
					<p>Once the application is received, and all 10 vendors have been decided upon, it is up to
					each vendor to arrive to the event prepared. This means requesting all necessary
					equipment between April 1st and June 1st 2019. Your name will be guest listed as
					VENDOR, when you arrive to the venue please have your ID ready. You will then be
					directed to parking, and upon request be given a tour of the venue. We are welcoming to
					our vendors to camp Friday June 7th and Saturday June 8th 2019, however some may
					choose to arrive day of.</p>
					<p><strong>(a)</strong> If chosen to camp for the duration of the weekend, you will be encouraged to set up
					your display area Friday before bed. This allows you proper time Saturday morning to
					wake up and have breakfast before getting to work.</p>
					<p><strong>(b)</strong> If chosen to arrive day of, Saturday June 8th you will have less time to prepare your
					display area and in turn make a profit. We will not allow any vendor to arrive later than
					7pm on the day of. This is due to reducing high volumes of traffic near the end of the
					event.</p>
					<p>There will be no refund of the service fee in the event that you do not arrive by 7pm
					Saturday June 8th 2019, or in the event you do not arrive at all.</p>
